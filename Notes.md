# Flutter-Course-for-Beginners
# What is Flutter
Flutter is open source UI framework which is developed by google. Used to develop cross platform applications for android, ios, linux, macos, windows.
# What is Dart
It is an open source, general purpose, object oriented programing languages. Its purpose is to create the frontend for both web and mobile app. It is compiled to build an mobile apps and is strongly typed. 
# Variable 
A variable is “a named space in the memory” that stores values. In other words, it acts a container for values in a program. Variable names are called identifiers.
# Const vs Final keywords
Const declare keyword as constant. We cannot change the value of the const keyword after assigning it.
Final keyword is used to restrict the user. It can be applied in many contexts, such as variables, classes, and methods.
# Keywords
Dart Keywords are the reserve words that have special meaning for the compiler. It cannot be used as the variable name, class name, or function name. Keywords are case sensitive; they must be written as they are defined.
# Arguments
Arguments are the values that we pass to the function
# Parameters
Parameters is the definition of the values which we pass in the function definition
# Functions
Function are "self contained" modules of code that are specific task. It hold our logic
# Optional Parameter
Optional Parameter is that the caller isn't required to specify a value for the parameter when calling the function.
# Prefix
The value is incremented first, then returned.
# Postfix
The value is returned, then incremented.
# List
A series of things that are similar to each other or list is simply an ordered group of objects. In C++ we use array but in dart we use list. List also dynamic. List are homogenous things. In list we should add another list. If we use maps in the list it can pick one by one elements from the list of items.
# Sets
A collection of objects in which each object can occur only once. It is an unordered collection of unique items. Dart is provided by set literals and the Set type. Sets are unique things. In set we can't add another set of any data and if we use any value so we can't use that duplicate value.
# Maps
Maps are used to hold key-value pairs of information. Both keys and values can be any type of object. Each key occurs only once, but you can use the same value multiple times. It also a data structure.
# Null Safety
Null is a keyword in dart. In simple words it means a variable cannot contain a 'null' value unless you initialized with null to that variable. It is not a value it's a absence of the value. In list if we use null so we use null in data type after and also use before in the variable.
# Cherry Picking non_nullable values
It can be used when the left side is null so it print right side value. We use this on if else statement and it will shorten your code a lot.
